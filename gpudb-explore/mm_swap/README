Below I explain how mm_swap works.
#################################

It intercepts:
CudaMalloc(void ** devPtr, size_t size)
CudaFree(void *devPtr)


In Malloc, the allocated gpu memory(object) has address *devPtr(GPU_address), which is in turn stored in devPtr(GPU_address_store)
So the simple IDEA is that
	mm_swap maintains the connection between the GPU_address and the GPU_address_store
	so once we swap out&in certain gpu object, the GPU_address will be changed, while we can update it inside GPU_address_store

Here lies an assumption
	the code will use(memcpy, launch) the *devPtr, where devPtr is used for malloc, to access the address

I know this sucks, so it rolls out along with two fixes
1.If Malloc takes a devPtr that happens to be the same devPtr that is used by a previous Malloc (but not freed), than the previous Malloc-ed object cannot be swapped out
2.When Malloc is returned, no swapped-out object exisits in current process


#############
The swapping policy

process i is given a unique priority number P(i) 
If any j cannot malloc due to lack of memory 
	&& P(j) > P(i)
Then there are two cases:
1. P(i) has in-gpu-mem objs && P(i) has the lowest priority of all SUCH processes
	swap out things one by one
2. else, just wait

Else, swap in everything, then finish the malloc. If anything fails, just WAIT









The mm_swap2 will introduce more of the traditional virtual memory ideas
############
It takes full control over the MEM system, which indicates

When Malloc, return a unique address (or ID) 
WHen Launch (or memCpy, or memset, or ...), replace this ID with the proper VM address
